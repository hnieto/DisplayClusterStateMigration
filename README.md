## Program Description

The application will parse a DisplayCluster .dcx file and extract the paths for each media file referenced in the state. Each file (including the .dcx) will then be copied into an output directory specified by the user. Finally, the copied .dcx and .pyr files will be edited by the script to point to the content in the output directory.
